                        Measure, Integration & Real Analysis, by Sheldon Axler
                    </li>
                    <li>Good introduction to the subject, Axler is very good at motivating some complex topics</li>
                    <li>
                        Excellent selection of exercises
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Does not go into as much depth as some other books
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arguably the biggest pro: It's free at <a href="https://measure.axler.net/" target="_blank">Axler's website!</a>

                    <li>
                        Although not dedicated to Measure Theory, the early chapters develop it and provide a nice exposure

                    <li>
                        As with all Rudin books, its extremely hard to fully parse and to do exercises from

                        Technically two separate volumes, covers nearly everything one needs to know about Measure Theory

                    <li>
                        Exercise selecetion is good, over a thousand across the two volumes

                    <li>
                        Requires some mathematical maturity to read, can be dense at times
