                        The studies of things that have stuff in them. It sounds silly, and that's because it somewhat is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set theory is the basis of all mathematics, and a field of study in its own right
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It posits a few axioms (statements that we define as true), and examines what is possible from those axioms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to its fundamental nature, set theory is very closely related to pure logic, philospohy, and theoretical computer science
                    </li>

                <h1>Real Analysis</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Real analysis is essentially the formalization of calculus
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The most important aspect of this formalization is that of the limit
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most first semester Real Analysis courses formalize all you would learn in Calculus I and II
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Later semesters generalize the results to multiple dimensions, infinite dimensions, and even on things that aren't real numbers at all
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Abstract Algebra</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The generalization of properties of operations, such as a+b=b+a
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Abstract Algebra asks "If I have a set with an operation that does this, how much do I know about the set and operation?"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This question is condensed into studying the properties of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, and modules
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Algebra has many applications you wouldn't think of at first glance, such as in physics, solving polynomials, and Rubik's cubes!

                <h1>Measure</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Can be considered a more advanced version of Real Analysis
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A measure is a generalization of the notion of length/volume to more wacky shapes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Measure theory was created to do things that the usual Real Analysis catalog is incapable of, such as integrating certain functions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Measure theory is also central to probability theory: a probability space is an example of a measure space
                    </li>
