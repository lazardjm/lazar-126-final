                        I aim to make learning advanced math more accessible to anyone who wants to learn it.

                    <li>
                        We sort our information along a wide range of topics, with more added as we come across new good materals

                        All resources are accompanied with a short review that entails the pros and cons of the resource, along with who I believe would benefit from it. Remember: no resource is perfect!

                    <li class="question">Is this a complete list?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No, and it does not try to be. This is only a selection of the best resources I have seen, and is ever expanding. I may even remove some entries if I find a resource that outclasses it in its own niche.</li>
                    <li class="question">Is this list free?</li>
                    <li class="answer">Yes, the entire list is free to everyone</li>
                    <li class="question">Are all resources free?</li>
                    <li class="answer">No. Unfortunately, most textbooks are quite expensive. Free ones will be noted, and out of respect for the authors, I will not say where to find the paid ones. No, this list contains no informations on websites such as Anna's archive, that promise free books. No such information at all</li>
